        Hi, my name is Miguel.
        \n\n I love music.
        \n\n The kind that is alive and swims around in an aqurium or river , or lake , and definitely the ocean.
        \n\n Fun fact is that I have several aquariums an also a river.
        \n\n I lik eating fish, too. Raw fish . Grilled fish. Smoked fish =. Poached fish - not so much.
        \n And sometimes I even go fishing.
        \n And even less somethimes, I actually catch something.
        \n\n Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hundry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        \n\n I\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \n You should ask someone else about fishing. though.\n\n
